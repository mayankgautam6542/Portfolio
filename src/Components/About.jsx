            Hey there! I'm Mayank, currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Technology at Delhi Technological University, specializing in Software Engineering. My journey into the world of development commenced just a few months ago, and I've found a genuine interest in this field. Specifically, my interests lie in crafting engaging and user-friendly web applications, with a primary focus on front-end development and quite familiar with back-end as well. Other than development I've a very strong problem solving skills and has solved over 500+ problems on different platforms like Leetcode, CodeChef, Codeforces. I've discovered a interest in machine learning as well and I'm diving into that field too.
